title: "Facebook vows to crack down on ‘misleading’ deepfakes"
excerpt: "Facebook today announced it will ban misleading manipulated media — including ... someone into thinking that a subject of the video said words that they did not actually say. It is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning that merges, replaces or superimposes content onto a video, making it appear to be authentic."
