title: "LEGO Sorting Machine Uses Neural Networks to Sort Any Piece"
excerpt: "Neutral networks sort the individual pieces discharged by the “vibration feeder.” The most astounding part of the universal LEGO sorter is its use of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, and even more specifically, convolutional neural networks. West describes in more detail how the neural networks work in the video below ..."

    excerpt: "If I ever had to sort that collection by hand, it would probably take me the better part of the next 20 years — but perhaps I could use this AI-powered Lego sorting machine that’s made in large part out of more than 10,000 Lego bricks (via ExtremeTech). Dubbed the “Universal Lego Sorting Machine” by its creator, Daniel West, it’s a ..."

  - title: "Watching This AI-Powered LEGO Brick Sorter Is Extremely Satisfying"
    excerpt: "West said that his universal LEGO sorter was inspired by two of these previous creations, including a 2011 model built by YouTuber Akiyuki Brick Channel, which was the first of these LEGO machines to sort a large number of pieces, and a 2017 machine that was the first to use AI to sort LEGO. For over two years, West has worked on his LEGO ..."

    excerpt: "Others go with the flow, look for the best deals whenever they find some time to shop, not even looking at the brands or what they chose in the past. So why not train a machine learning model to predict the next purchase a given customer will make and estimate when this transaction will take place? There are two approaches to the challenge of ..."
