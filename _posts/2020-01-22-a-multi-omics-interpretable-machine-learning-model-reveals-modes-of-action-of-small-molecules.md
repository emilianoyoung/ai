title: "A Multi-Omics Interpretable Machine Learning Model Reveals Modes of Action of Small Molecules"
excerpt: "We developed an approach for uncovering MoAs through an interpretable machine learning model of transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. Examining compounds with beneficial effects in models of Huntingtonâ€™s Disease, we found common MoAs for compounds with unrelated structures, connectivity scores, and binding targets."
