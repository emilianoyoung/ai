title: "NVIDIA GPU Performance In Arnold, Redshift, Octane, V-Ray & Dimension"
excerpt: "We remember V-Ray being one of the first places we saw AI denoise hit consumers. On the CPU side, the renderer seems to favor Intel CPUs a bit more than AMD, as we’ve seen in the past – although that’s just from a core count standpoint, not an overall chip value standpoint. For GPU, the scaling seems almost ideal. You get what you pay for ..."
