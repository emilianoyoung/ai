title: "The Case for a Light Hand With AI and a Hard Line on China"
excerpt: "Last week, at the WIRED HQ at CES, I spoke with Michael Kratsios, the chief technology officer of the United States.

    excerpt: "From there, formal will give valuable input to the whole system verification. SE: One of the problems with those chips, particularly the ones used for safety, is that the AI running on those systems are basically opaque.
