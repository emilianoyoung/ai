title: "The Case for a Light Hand With AI and a Hard Line on China"
excerpt: "Last week, at the WIRED HQ at CES, I spoke with Michael Kratsios, the chief technology officer of the United States.

    excerpt: "From there, formal will give valuable input to the whole system verification. SE: One of the problems with those chips, particularly the ones used for safety, is that the AI running on those systems are basically opaque. Is there any progress in understanding what can go wrong with those algorithms? Brinkmann: The machine learning guys are ..."
