title: "The Case for a Light Hand With AI and a Hard Line on China"
excerpt: "Last week, at the WIRED HQ at CES, I spoke with Michael Kratsios, the chief technology officer of the United States. We dug into the governmentâ€™s recent regulatory framework for AI, the potential for an AI cold war with China, and whether or not the NSA is building a quantum computer. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity."
