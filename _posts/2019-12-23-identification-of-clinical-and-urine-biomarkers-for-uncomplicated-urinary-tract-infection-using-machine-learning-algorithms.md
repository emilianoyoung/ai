title: "Identification of clinical and urine biomarkers for uncomplicated urinary tract infection using machine learning algorithms"
excerpt: "The identified urinary biomarkers could be used to develop a point of care test for UTI but require further validation. This is one of the first studies to use machine learning methods to select clinical features and urinary immunological markers to predict culture results for uncomplicated UTI in primary care. We found that cloudiness of urine ..."
