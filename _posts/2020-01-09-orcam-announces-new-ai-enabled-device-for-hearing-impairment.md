excerpt: "You pair it with your existing Bluetooth hearing aids. Finally, OrCam is introducing the OrCam Read, a handheld AI reader. This time, you donâ€™t clip a camera to your glasses. You take the device in your hand and point it at text. The company says it could be particularly useful for people who have reading difficulties due to dyslexia."
