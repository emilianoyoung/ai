title: "What it’s like to ride in a self-driving Lyft"
excerpt: "At CES, the consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas this week, I hit the jackpot: getting picked up in a self-driving Lyft.

    excerpt: "There has been a lot of speculation that one of these days there will be an AI system that suddenly and unexpectedly gives rise to consciousness. Often referred to as the singularity, there is much hand-wringing that we are perhaps dooming ourselves to either utter death and destruction or to becoming slaves of AI once the singularity occurs."

    excerpt: "Many popular EVs do, in fact, sport a 200-plus mile range, which leads us to other hurdles like charging and the initial purchase price. On the flip side of things, the study also looked at self-driving cars and autonomous technology. Here, it wasn't a very rosy picture. Almost half of Americans in the survey said \"autonomous cars will be ..."

    excerpt: "Last year at CES, I rode in what felt like an endless stream of self-driving cars up and down the Las Vegas Strip. Lo and behold, for every ride a \"safety engineer\" or \"operator\" was inches from the steering wheel, foot hovering above the brake. Safety first, I get it. But still, lame.
