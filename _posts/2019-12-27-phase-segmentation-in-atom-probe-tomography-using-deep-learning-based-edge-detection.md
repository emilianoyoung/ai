title: "Phase Segmentation in Atom-Probe Tomography Using Deep Learning-Based Edge Detection"
excerpt: "Alternatively, edge (contour) detection has been significantly improved with deep learning approaches 18. A supervised learning approach is used for edge detection, wherein each pixel is labeled as either edge or nonedge. This approach is slightly different from semantic segmentation in that there are only two classes (edge and noedge ..."

    excerpt: "Here we report a facile, prompt protocol based on deep-learning techniques to sort out intricate phase identification and quantification problems in complex multiphase inorganic compounds. We simulate plausible powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns for 170 inorganic compounds in the Sr-Li-Al-O quaternary compositional pool, wherein ..."
