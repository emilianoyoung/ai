title: "Phase Segmentation in Atom-Probe Tomography Using Deep Learning-Based Edge Detection"
excerpt: "Alternatively, edge (contour) detection has been significantly improved with deep learning approaches 18. A supervised learning approach is used for edge detection, wherein each pixel is labeled as either edge or nonedge. This approach is slightly different from semantic segmentation in that there are only two classes (edge and noedge ..."

    excerpt: "To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70\\(\\%\\) of the cases, the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable ..."
