title: "Machine learning greatly reduces uncertainty in understanding of paleozoic biodiversity"
excerpt: "Now, by combining ancient marine fossils with modern machine learning and one of the world's most powerful supercomputers, researchers have composed a new record of Paleozoic biodiversity in which the age of average fossil layers can be resolved to within 26,000 years, the authors say. The computational approach allowed Jun-xuan Fan and ..."
