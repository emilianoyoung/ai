  - title: "Automating financial decision making with deep reinforcement learning"
    excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is routinely used in every sector to make predictions. But beyond simple predictions, making decisions is more complicated because non-optimal short-term decisions are sometimes preferred or even necessary to enable long-term, strategic goals. Optimizing policies to make sequential"
