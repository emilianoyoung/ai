title: "Stanford Engineers Taught a Self-Driving DeLorean to Drift"
excerpt: "Since then, mechanical engineer Chris Gerdes and his students developed the self-driving car to drift through a multi-turn, kilometer-long track in just a matter of minutes at a level that’s nearly as good as real professionals. The DeLorean uses GPS coordinates and the algorithms on Jonathan Goh’s laptop to chart its path, meaning those ..."

  - title: "Marty, the self-driving DeLorean engineered to dominate test courses"
    excerpt: "Imagine if Marty McFly never actually had to drive the DeLorean in Back to the Future, imagine if the DeLorean just drove itself at 88mph. Standford Unversity engineers perhaps thought of the same thing and decided to make a 1981 DMC DeLorean be independent of its human driver. In the above video released onto the Stanford YouTube Channel ..."
