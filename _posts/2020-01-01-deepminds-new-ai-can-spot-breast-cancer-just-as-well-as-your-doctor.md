title: "DeepMind's new AI can spot breast cancer just as well as your doctor"
excerpt: "False negatives, when cancer is present but not spotted, can prove deadly, while false positives can be distressing. Google-owned DeepMind has already worked with NHS organisations to develop AI to read eye scans and spot neck cancer. Over the past two years, researchers from Cancer Research UK Imperial College, Northwestern University ..."

    excerpt: "In the paper, researchers detail the successful results of an AI model able to identify breast cancer in mammograms missed by radiologists when tested against scans of over 25,000 women from the UK and over 3,000 women from the US. The AI, which was trained on anonymized mammograms, was also able to reduce the number of false diagnoses of ..."

    excerpt: "The AI screened with fewer false positives and false negatives than humans. DeepMind, a UK-based artificial intelligence company purchased by Google in 2014, has turned its sights to the problem of breast cancer detection. Although breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, detection is difficult due to high rates of false ..."
