title: "Organic molecular crystal-based photosynaptic devices for an artificial visual-perception system"
excerpt: "Recreating the visual-perception properties using organic electronic devices is highly desired for visual prosthetics and artificial intelligence. Although the integration of organic light-sensing components with synaptic devices can realize the recognition and memory functions for perceived images, complicated problems in device integration ..."
