title: "A bioinspired analogous nerve towards artificial intelligence"
excerpt: "Like the functions of biological sensory nerves, the proposed APT nerve had the potential to target human-machine interaction based on artificial intelligence, such as user identification, feedback control of prosthesis, and intelligent action of a robot. Figure 4a illustrates a basic process flow combined with algorithmic analysis of ..."
