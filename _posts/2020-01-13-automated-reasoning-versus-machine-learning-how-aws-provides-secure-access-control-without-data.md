title: "Automated reasoning versus machine learning: How AWS provides secure access control without data"
excerpt: "Turns out, the same goes for machines. The intelligence required for facial recognition demands a very different learning base than the reasoning applied to security tasks such as access control. So, rather than approaching security from the machine-learning standpoint of ingesting masses of data, Amazon Web Services Inc. is training AI in a ..."
