title: "Comparison of different input modalities and network structures for deep learning-based seizure detection"
excerpt: "The manual review of an electroencephalogram (EEG) for seizure detection is a laborious and error-prone process. Thus, automated seizure detection based on machine learning has been studied for decades. Recently, deep learning has been adopted in order to avoid manual feature extraction and selection. In the present study, we systematically ..."

    excerpt: "The metabolic derangement is common in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of the study was to check feasibility of the combined approach of untargeted metabolomics and machine learning to create a simple and potentially clinically useful diagnostic panel for HFrEF. The study included 67 chronic HFrEF patients (left ..."
