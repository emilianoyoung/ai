excerpt: "Sensors and cameras (and a little dose of artificial intelligence) tell the arms where things like the salt and pepper are, and I watched as the arms helped a (human) cook make a bowl of tofu salad. Samsung calls it a collaborative robot, so it's not meant to cook from start to finish without any help, but it can take some tasks off your hands ..."

    excerpt: "The robot thus formed could determine the state of an object by touch. Subsequently, research work on computer image processing and object recognition using TV cameras. In 1968, J. McCarthy and others at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the United States studied a novel subject-developing computer systems with hands ..."
