title: "Machine learning for clinical decision-making: pay attention to what you don’t see"
excerpt: "It has become commonplace to evaluate machine learning algorithms based on overall measures like accuracy or area under the curve. However, one evaluation metric cannot capture the complexity of performance. Be wary of research that claims to be ready for translation into clinical practice but only presents a “leader board” of tools that ..."
