title: "Robust profiling of microRNAs and isomiRs in human plasma exosomes across 46 individuals"
excerpt: "Here they bind to complementary mRNA molecules leading to either degradation of the mRNA or inhibition of translation 2. AGO, with the miRNA ... The libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced on a NextSeq500 machine as single-end reads (51 nucleotides) with an average depth of 22 million reads per sample. FASTQ files were generated ..."
