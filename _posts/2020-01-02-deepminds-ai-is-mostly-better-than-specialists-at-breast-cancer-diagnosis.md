  - title: "Google DeepMind AI Can Diagnose Breast Cancer With Human-Like Accuracy"
    excerpt: "Some areas have a shortage of doctors who can make a diagnosis from medical scans, so Google's DeepMind AI has been trained to find breast cancer in screening scans as accurately or better than a radiologist. Google hopes that the research, which is still in the early stages, will lead to less misdiagnosed cases and help to alleviate shortages ..."
