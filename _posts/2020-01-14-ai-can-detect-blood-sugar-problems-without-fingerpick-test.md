title: "AI can detect blood sugar problems without fingerpick test"
excerpt: "In a new study, researchers have developed a new technique using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect low blood sugar from raw ECG signals ... Basing on this information, doctors s can adapt the therapy to each patient. More clinical research is required to confirm these results in wider populations. One author of the study is Dr. Leandro ..."

  - title: "Sensory Does Voice Recognition Without the ‘Net"
    excerpt: "But there are some who think that way. Hence, a product like Sensory’s Truly Natural voice recognition can be used in an application that’s not connected to the Internet. I saw a demo of this technology last week at CES and was quite impressed. The company created a video that shows a microwave oven that’s enabled by voice commands."
