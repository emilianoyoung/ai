title: "AI Resists Ethics and Explanation. So Why Is It Still Used?"
excerpt: "For example, it is not at all clear, either technically or philosophically, what is meant when it is proposed, as many people suggest, that we should ‘build ethics into AI’. Nor is it obvious what is meant when people demand that software engineers should ‘program’ their machine learning systems to provide intelligible explanations."
