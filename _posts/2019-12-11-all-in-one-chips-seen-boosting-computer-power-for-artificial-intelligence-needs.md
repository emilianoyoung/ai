title: "All-in-one chips seen boosting computer power for artificial intelligence needs"
excerpt: "Researchers and companies working with AI technologies have had to make do with off-the-shelf hardware that was not originally built for the massive amount of computational power required to perform these tasks. The available standard digital platforms, the chips and the processors, are “not suited for this,” Kvatinsky said. “The hardware ..."
