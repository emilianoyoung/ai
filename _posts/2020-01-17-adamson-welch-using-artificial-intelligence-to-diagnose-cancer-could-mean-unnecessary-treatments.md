    excerpt: "Researchers at Google Health teamed up with academic medical centers in the United States and Britain to train an AI system using tens of thousands of mammograms.

    excerpt: "The dating sites hope this will enable them to project more diversity, while the AI startups are counting on dating sites to help normalize their disconcerting technology. Having AI-generated people lure us to dating sites might sound like one further slide into sci-fi dystopia. But it’s not that different from what’s already going on."
