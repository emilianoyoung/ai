title: "Performance of deep learning-based algorithm for detection of ileocolic intussusception on abdominal radiographs of young children"
excerpt: "The purpose of this study was to develop and test the performance of a deep learning-based algorithm to detect ileocolic intussusception using abdominal radiographs of young children. For the training set, children (â‰¤5 years old) who underwent abdominal radiograph and ultrasonography (US) for suspicion of intussusception from March 2005 to ..."
