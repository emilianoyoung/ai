  - title: "Biophysical prediction of protein–peptide interactions and signaling networks using machine learning"
    excerpt: "Here, we introduce a bespoke machine-learning approach, hierarchical statistical mechanical modeling (HSM), capable of accurately predicting the affinities of PBD–peptide interactions across multiple protein families. By synthesizing biophysical priors within a modern machine-learning framework, HSM outperforms existing computational methods ..."

  - title: "Deep learning for detecting retinal detachment and discerning macular status using ultra-widefield fundus images"
    excerpt: "Manual retinal detachment screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is difficult for large-scale clinical applications. In this study, we developed a cascaded deep learning system based on the ultra-widefield fundus images for automated retinal detachment detection and macula-on/off retinal detachment discerning. The performance ..."

    excerpt: "It also may lead to better management and utilization of bees as pollinators. We address an investigation with Recurrent Neural Networks in the task of forecasting bees’ level of activity taking into account previous values of level of activity and environmental data such as temperature, solar irradiance and barometric pressure. We also show ..."
