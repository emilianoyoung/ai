  - title: "Biophysical prediction of protein–peptide interactions and signaling networks using machine learning"
    excerpt: "Here, we introduce a bespoke machine-learning approach, hierarchical statistical mechanical modeling (HSM), capable of accurately predicting the affinities of PBD–peptide interactions across multiple protein families. By synthesizing biophysical priors within a modern machine-learning framework, HSM outperforms existing computational methods ..."
