title: "Facebook taught its AI to speak math"
excerpt: "Facebook managed this by not treating the equation like a math problem but rather like a language problem. Specifically the research team approached the issue using neural machine translation (NMT). In short, they taught an AI to speak math. The result was a system capable of solving equations in a fraction of the time that algebra-based ..."

  - title: "Facebook Invented a New Language for Machines to Solve Complex Math Equations"
    excerpt: "Similar to diagramming a sentence, the program turns equations into a tree that can be read by a computer like any other language. There’s already an extensive amount of research in machine translation, so the Facebook AI team simply used a popular translation model to map problems to solutions. “Our solution was an entirely new approach ..."
