title: "Decrappifying brain images with deep learning"
excerpt: "\"If you know the optical properties of your system, then you can deblur your images and get twice the resolution of the original,\" he explained. They believed that deep learning -- a form of machine-learning that uses multiple layers of analysis to progressively extract higher level features from raw input -- could be very useful for increasing ..."

  - title: "Deep learning for detecting retinal detachment and discerning macular status using ultra-widefield fundus images"
    excerpt: "Manual retinal detachment screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is difficult for large-scale clinical applications. In this study, we developed a cascaded deep learning system based on the ultra-widefield fundus images for automated retinal detachment detection and macula-on/off retinal detachment discerning. The performance ..."
