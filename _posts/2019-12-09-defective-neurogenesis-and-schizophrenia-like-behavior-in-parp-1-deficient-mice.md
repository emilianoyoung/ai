title: "Defective neurogenesis and schizophrenia-like behavior in PARP-1-deficient mice"
excerpt: "6: PARP-1 KO mice exhibited reduced brain weight and decreased proliferation of adult NSCs. For testing the cognitive capability of PARP-1 KO mice, Y-maze spontaneous alternation and novel object recognition tests were performed. PARP-1 KO mice exhibited impaired long-term recognition memory in addition to impaired spatial working memory."
