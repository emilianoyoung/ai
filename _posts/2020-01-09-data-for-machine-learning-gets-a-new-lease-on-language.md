    excerpt: "\"If you know the optical properties of your system, then you can deblur your images and get twice the resolution of the original,\" he explained. They believed that deep learning -- a form of machine-learning that uses multiple layers of analysis to progressively extract higher level features from raw input -- could be very useful for increasing ..."

  - title: "Machine learning shapes microwaves for a computer's eyes"
    excerpt: "The new machine-learning approach cuts out the middleman, skipping the step of creating an image for analysis by a human and instead analyzes the pure data directly. It also jointly determines optimal hardware settings that reveal the most important data while simultaneously discovering what the most important data actually is. In a proof-of ..."
