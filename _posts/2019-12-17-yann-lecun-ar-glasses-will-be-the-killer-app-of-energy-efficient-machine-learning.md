title: "Yann LeCun: AR glasses will be the killer app of energy-efficient machine learning"
excerpt: "He also talked about specific deep learning approaches like differential associative memory and convolutional neural networks that pose a challenge and may require new hardware. Differential associative memory, or soft RAM, is a kind of computation that’s currently widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and that’s beginning to ..."
