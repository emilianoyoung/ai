title: "Machine learning with autophagy-related proteins for discriminating renal cell carcinoma subtypes"
excerpt: "Machine learning techniques have been previously applied for classification of tumors based largely on morphological features of tumor cells recognized in H&E images. Here, we tested the possibility of using numeric data acquired from software-based quantification of certain marker proteins, i.e. key autophagy proteins (ATGs), obtained from ..."
