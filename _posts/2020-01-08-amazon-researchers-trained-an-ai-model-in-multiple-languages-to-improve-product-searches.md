title: "Amazon researchers trained an AI model in multiple languages to improve product searches"
excerpt: "They say that their AI, which was trained on data from several different languages at once, delivered better results using any of those languages. As Amazon applied scientist Nikhil Rao explained in a blog post, the reason for the improvement is that a corpus in one language is able to fill gaps in that of another language. For instance ..."
