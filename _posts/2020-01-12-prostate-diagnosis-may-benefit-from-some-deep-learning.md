title: "Prostate diagnosis may benefit from some deep learning"
excerpt: "Now Dutch researchers from Radboud University have developed a “deep learning” system they say is better than most pathologists at determining the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. It actually does the very same job – analysing pieces of tissue (biopsies) taken from the prostate then calculating a Gleason score, which provides a grading ..."

    excerpt: "Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with ..."

  - title: "An algorithm that learns through rewards may show how our brain does too"
    excerpt: "In a paper published in Nature today, DeepMind, Alphabet’s AI subsidiary, has once again used lessons from reinforcement learning to propose a new theory about the reward mechanisms within our brains. The hypothesis, supported by initial experimental findings, could not only improve our understanding of mental health and motivation."
