title: "New Tool from MIT Uses Machine Learning to Predict Code Performance on a Chip"
excerpt: "Now, MIT has highlighted a new tool by its researchers that uses machine learning to more accurately, easily and quickly predict code performance on computer chips. In essence, the new automated pipeline – called “Ithemal” – trains itself on labeled snippets of code (“basic blocks”) and uses that training to predict how long it will ..."

    excerpt: "In three papers released over the past seven months, ten computer scientists describe Ithemal (Instruction THroughput Estimator using MAchine Learning), a tool for predicting the number processor clock cycles necessary to execute an instruction sequence when looped in steady state, and include a supporting benchmark and algorithm. Throughput ..."
