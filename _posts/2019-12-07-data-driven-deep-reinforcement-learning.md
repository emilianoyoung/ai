title: "Data-driven deep reinforcement learning"
excerpt: "One of the primary factors behind the success of machine learning approaches in open world settings, such as image recognition and natural language processing, has been the ability of high-capacity deep neural network function approximators to learn generalizable models from large amounts of data. Deep reinforcement learning methods ..."

  - title: "DeepMind proposes novel way to train ‘safe’ reinforcement learning AI"
    excerpt: "Reinforcement learning agents — or AI that’s progressively spurred toward goals via rewards (or punishments) — form the foundation of self-driving cars, dexterous robots, and drug discovery systems. But because they’re predisposed to explore unfamiliar states, they’re susceptible to what’s called the safe exploration problem ..."
