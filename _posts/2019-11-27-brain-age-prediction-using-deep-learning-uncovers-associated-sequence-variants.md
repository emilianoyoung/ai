title: "Brain age prediction using deep learning uncovers associated sequence variants"
excerpt: "Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have garnered much interest 9. These methods learn features that are important without a priori bias or hypothesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 10 are deep learning techniques that are especially powerful for image processing and computer vision. Previously, they have been applied to brain age ..."

  - title: "Automating financial decision making with deep reinforcement learning"
    excerpt: "Machine learning (ML) is routinely used in every sector to make predictions. But beyond simple predictions, making decisions is more complicated because non-optimal short-term decisions are sometimes preferred or even necessary to enable long-term, strategic goals. Optimizing policies to make sequential"
