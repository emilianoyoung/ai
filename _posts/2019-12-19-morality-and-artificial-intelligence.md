title: "Morality and artificial intelligence?"
excerpt: "What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you read the words ‘artificial intelligence’? Do you think of an algorithm that could solve climate change, or of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey? Be honest. My point is: AI has become a loaded term, as has data. People are weary, even fearful, of new technology – but then, that’s nothing new."
