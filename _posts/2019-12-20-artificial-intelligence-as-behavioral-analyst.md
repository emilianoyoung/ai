title: "Artificial intelligence as behavioral analyst"
excerpt: "\"To understand how the brain generates behavior, we need to know the \"syllables,\" the building blocks of the behavior.\" Aided by artificial intelligence, Mearns and his colleagues from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology have broken down the hunting behavior of larval zebrafish into its basic building blocks. They show how these building ..."
