title: "Machine learning could reveal graphene oxide’s real structure"
excerpt: "What is the actual structure of graphene oxide nanoflakes? This question is important for optimizing the properties of the carbon material in real-world applications, and researchers at CSIRO in Australia have now tried to answer it using machine learning. Their approach uses over 20,000 possible structure candidates to find truly ..."
