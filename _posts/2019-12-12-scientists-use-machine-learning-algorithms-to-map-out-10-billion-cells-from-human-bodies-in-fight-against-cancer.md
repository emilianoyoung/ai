title: "Scientists use machine-learning algorithms to map out 10 billion cells from human bodies in fight against cancer"
excerpt: "Microsoft movie tried to Azure Ignite attendees about CPU side-channel flaws ... a research lab focused cancer treatment in New York, described machine learning as a toolbox for building the Human Cell Atlas. The project aims to turn data from billions of tissue sample cells into 3D maps so scientists can visualize our bodies down at the ..."

    excerpt: "AI and ML algorithms are only as good as the data they learn from. If they are trained to make decisions using a data set that doesn’t include enough examples or biased examples of certain groups of people, they will produce unintentionally biased results—or worse, decisions, as appears to be the case with the Apple Card. If a collection of ..."
