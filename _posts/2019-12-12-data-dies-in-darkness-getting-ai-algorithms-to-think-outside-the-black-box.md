title: "Data Dies In Darkness: Getting AI Algorithms To Think Outside The Black Box"
excerpt: "AI and ML algorithms are only as good as the data they learn from. If they are trained to make decisions using a data set that doesn’t include enough examples or biased examples of certain groups of people, they will produce unintentionally biased results—or worse, decisions, as appears to be the case with the Apple Card. If a collection of ..."
