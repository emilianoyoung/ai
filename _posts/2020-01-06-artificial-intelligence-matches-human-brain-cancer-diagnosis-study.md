title: "Artificial Intelligence matches human brain cancer diagnosis: study"
excerpt: "PARIS, France - An Artificial Intelligence (AI) computer model can diagnose and identify 10 of the most common types of brain cancer with the same accuracy as human doctors, researchers said Monday. More than 15 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer every year, and 80 percent of those will undergo surgery. In the United States ..."

    excerpt: "What they did: The research team developed an AI model trained on more than 2.5 million images. They combined the algorithm with a laser-based optical imaging technique called stimulated Raman histology (SRH). They tested this combination on 278 brain tumor patients at three hospitals for the 10 most common types of brain cancer. What they ..."
