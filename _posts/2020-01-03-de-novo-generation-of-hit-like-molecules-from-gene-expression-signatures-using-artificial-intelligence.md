title: "De novo generation of hit-like molecules from gene expression signatures using artificial intelligence"
excerpt: "Finding new molecules with a desired biological activity is an extremely difficult task. In this context, artificial intelligence and generative models have been used for molecular de novo design and compound optimization. Herein, we report a generative model that bridges systems biology and molecular design, conditioning a generative ..."
