title: "Deep learning enables real-time imaging around corners"
excerpt: "Researchers have harnessed the power of a type of artificial intelligence known as deep learning to create a new laser-based system that can image around corners in real time. With further development, the system might let self-driving cars \"look\" around parked cars or busy intersections to see hazards or pedestrians. It could also be installed ..."

  - title: "Researchers propose system that taps AI to see hidden objects around corners"
    excerpt: "To reconstruct the object from the speckle pattern, the researchers tapped an AI algorithm trained on synthesized data of characterized noise, which eliminated the need to capture experimental training samples. Crucially, it’s able to operate with the shorter exposure times necessary for real-time imaging, exaplined coauthor Prasanna ..."

  - title: "Artificial Intelligence system created to allows self-driving cars to 'see' around corners"
    excerpt: "An artificial intelligence system that allows self-driving cars to 'see' around corners in real time could help prevent accidents, according to its developers. Researchers from Stanford University in the USA have created a system that bounces a laser beam off a wall to create an 'image' of objects hidden from view. The 'image' captured won't ..."
