title: "Provable guarantees come to the rescue to break attack-defense cycle in adversarial machine learning"
excerpt: "Adversarial examples exploit weaknesses in modern AI. Today, most successful AI applications use machine learning (more specifically, supervised learning) by training big neural networks to mimic input-output mappings on sample data. But this technique relies on the assumption that new input data coming in is somewhat similar to the sample data ..."
