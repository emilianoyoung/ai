    excerpt: "In the paper, researchers detail the successful results of an AI model able to identify breast cancer in mammograms missed by radiologists when tested against scans of over 25,000 women from the UK and over 3,000 women from the US. The AI, which was trained on anonymized mammograms, was also able to reduce the number of false diagnoses of ..."

    excerpt: "Google Health today shared an AI model trained with more than 90,000 mammogram x-rays that achieve better results than human radiology experts while recognizing more of false negatives, the kind of images that look normal but contain breast cancer. Initial findings were published in Nature. The model achieves lower rates of false-positives (5.7 ..."
