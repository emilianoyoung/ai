title: "Researchers use deep learning method to delve into predicting RNA structures in world first"
excerpt: "RNA and DNA are among the four major macromolecules in lifeforms. The team employed the use of deep learning—a subset of artificial intelligence used to create complex, numerical functions to approximate specific tasks automatically without explicit human instructions—to build a more accurate model of the relationship between RNA sequence ..."
