    excerpt: "The metabolic derangement is common in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of the study was to check feasibility of the combined approach of untargeted metabolomics and machine learning to create a simple and potentially clinically useful diagnostic panel for HFrEF. The study included 67 chronic HFrEF patients (left ..."
