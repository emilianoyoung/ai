title: "PyTorch3d is FAIR's library of reusable components for deep learning with 3D data."
excerpt: "Data structure for storing and manipulating triangle meshes Efficient operations on triangle meshes (projective transformations, graph convolution, sampling, loss functions) A differentiable mesh renderer PyTorch3d is designed to integrate smoothly with deep learning methods for predicting and manipulating 3D data. For this reason, all ..."
