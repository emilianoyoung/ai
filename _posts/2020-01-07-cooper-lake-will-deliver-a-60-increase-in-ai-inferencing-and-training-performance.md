title: "Cooper Lake will deliver a 60% increase in AI inferencing and training performance"
excerpt: "(Bfloat16 was originally by Google and implemented in its third generation Tensor Processing Unit, a custom-designed AI accelerator chip.) By way of refresher, Cooper Lake features up to 56 processor cores per socket, or twice the processor core count of Intel’s second-gen Scalable Xeon chips. They’ll also have higher memory bandwidth ..."
