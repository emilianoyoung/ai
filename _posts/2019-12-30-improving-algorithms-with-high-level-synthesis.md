title: "Improving Algorithms With High-Level Synthesis"
excerpt: "Sometimes the results of HLS are seen feeding back into the algorithm. Klein said he recently worked on a voice recognition system in which the original TensorFlow algorithm, as defined by the data scientists, called for a feature map of spectral data in a 99 x 40 array of floating-point numbers. â€œThat worked great when the algorithm was ..."
