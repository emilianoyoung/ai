title: "Improving Algorithms With High-Level Synthesis"
excerpt: "Sometimes the results of HLS are seen feeding back into the algorithm. Klein said he recently worked on a voice recognition system in which the original TensorFlow algorithm, as defined by the data scientists, called for a feature map of spectral data in a 99 x 40 array of floating-point numbers. “That worked great when the algorithm was ..."

    excerpt: "the AI will be trained with the generated database and will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning algorithms, so that the spoken language is recognized, converted into gestures and expressions of sign language which the Realatar can execute. Finally, thanks to HbbTV technologies, the Realatar is made accessible to people ..."
