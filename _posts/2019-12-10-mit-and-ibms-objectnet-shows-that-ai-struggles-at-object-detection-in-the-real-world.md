title: "MIT and IBM’s ObjectNet shows that AI struggles at object detection in the real world"
excerpt: "Object recognition models have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade, but they’ve got a long way to go where accuracy is concerned. That’s the conclusion of a joint team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and IBM, which recently released a data set — ObjectNet — designed to illustrate the performance gap between ..."

    excerpt: "But it turns out that the technology could also help give us a better understanding of ourselves. At least that's what a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) think they'll be able to do with their new AI model. Dubbed ADEPT, the system is able to, like a human being, understand some laws of physics intuitively."
