title: "MIT and IBM’s ObjectNet shows that AI struggles at object detection in the real world"
excerpt: "Object recognition models have improved by leaps and bounds over the past decade, but they’ve got a long way to go where accuracy is concerned. That’s the conclusion of a joint team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and IBM, which recently released a data set — ObjectNet — designed to illustrate the performance gap between ..."

    excerpt: "The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill Artificial intelligence (AI) will shape the destiny of humanity, but first humanity has the opportunity to shape AI. At times, anxiety about the former causes us to overlook the latter. We forget that artificial intelligence is going to serve the goals with which we ..."

    excerpt: "In an effort to close this performance gap, a team of MIT and IBM researchers set out to create a very different kind of object-recognition dataset. It’s called ObjectNet, a play on ImageNet, the crowdsourced database of photos responsible for launching much of the modern boom in artificial intelligence. Unlike ImageNet, which features photos ..."

    excerpt: "Though humans can perceive the movement of objects using their shadows, we cannot determine their colors and may not be able to determine their shape. The newly detailed MIT AI can, however, recreate videos that include hints about an object's color and shape based on the shadows it produces. As demonstrated in the video above, the AI was ..."
