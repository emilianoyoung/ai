title: "IBM’s biologically-inspired AI generates hash codes faster than classical approaches"
excerpt: "To overcome this limitation, researchers at Princeton, the University of San Diego, IBM Research, and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab developed BioHash, which applies “local” and “biologically plausible” synaptic plasticity rules to produce hash codes. They say that it outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing methods ..."

  - title: "Facebook’s AI learns the relationships between physical places from first-person video footage"
    excerpt: "That’s why a team of researchers from the University of Texas and Facebook AI Research investigated in a paper Ego-Topo, a technique that decomposes a space captured in a video into a topological map of activities before organizing the video into a series of visits to different zones. By reorganizing scenes into these “visits” as opposed ..."
