title: "Deep-learning-based quality filtering of mechanically exfoliated 2D crystals"
excerpt: "Here, we present a deep-learning-based method to segment and identify the thickness of atomic layer flakes from optical microscopy images. Through carefully designing a neural network based on U-Net, we found that our neural network based on U-net trained only with the data based on realistically small number of images successfully distinguish ..."
