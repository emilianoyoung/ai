title: "Solving the transcription start site identification problem with ADAPT-CAGE: a Machine Learning algorithm for the analysis of CAGE data"
excerpt: "We present ADAPT-CAGE, a Machine Learning framework which is trained to distinguish between CAGE signal derived from TSSs and transcriptional noise. ADAPT-CAGE provides highly accurate experimentally derived TSSs on a genome-wide scale. It has been specifically designed for flexibility and ease-of-use by only requiring aligned CAGE data and the ..."
