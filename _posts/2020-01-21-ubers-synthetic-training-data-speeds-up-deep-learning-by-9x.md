title: "Uber's Synthetic Training Data Speeds Up Deep Learning by 9x"
excerpt: "Using this synthetic data, Uber sped up its neural architecture search (NAS) deep-learning optimization process by 9x. In a paper published on arXiv, the team described the system and a series of experiments. GTN is motivated by the problem of neural architecture search (NAS), which trains many different deep-learning model structures and ..."
