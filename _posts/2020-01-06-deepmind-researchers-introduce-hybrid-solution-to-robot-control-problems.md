title: "DeepMind researchers introduce hybrid solution to robot control problems"
excerpt: "They’re often difficult to tackle, because it’s not always obvious which algorithms or control policies might best fit. That’s why researchers at Google parent company Alphabet’s DeepMind recently proposed a technique — continuous-discrete hybrid learning — that optimizes for discrete and continuous actions simultaneously ..."
