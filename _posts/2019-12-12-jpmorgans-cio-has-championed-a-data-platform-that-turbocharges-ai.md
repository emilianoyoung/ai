title: "JPMorgan’s CIO Has Championed A Data Platform That Turbocharges AI"
excerpt: "JPMorgan Chase sees artificial intelligence (AI) as critical to its future success. And the mega-bank has a big advantage over many of its smaller rivals: the massive amount of data it gathers from sources such as the 50% of U.S. households with which it has some form of relationship and the $6 trillion-worth of payment flows it handles daily."
