title: "Sensory Does Voice Recognition Without the ‘Net"
excerpt: "But there are some who think that way. Hence, a product like Sensory’s Truly Natural voice recognition can be used in an application that’s not connected to the Internet. I saw a demo of this technology last week at CES and was quite impressed. The company created a video that shows a microwave oven that’s enabled by voice commands."
