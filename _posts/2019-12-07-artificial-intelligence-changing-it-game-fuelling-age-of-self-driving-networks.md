    excerpt: "Neural network for projecting onto the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP To model the non-linear structure of the underlying 2D EMT–MET state map, we constructed a single-layer-hidden artificial neural network model using the above six markers as input and the reduced 2D t-SNE feature space as a bivariate response. Specifically, we used the six input ..."
