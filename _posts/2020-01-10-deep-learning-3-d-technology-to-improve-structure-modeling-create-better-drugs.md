title: "Deep learning, 3-D technology to improve structure modeling, create better drugs"
excerpt: "Now, Purdue University researchers have designed a novel approach to use deep learning to better understand how proteins interact in the bodyâ€”paving the way to producing accurate structure models of protein interactions involved in various diseases and to design better drugs that specifically target protein interactions. The work is released ..."

    excerpt: "Kihara and his team developed a system called DOVE, DOcking decoy selection with Voxel-based deep neural nEtwork, which applies deep learning principles to virtual models of protein interactions. DOVE scans the protein-protein interface of a model and then uses deep learning model principles to distinguish and capture structural features of ..."
