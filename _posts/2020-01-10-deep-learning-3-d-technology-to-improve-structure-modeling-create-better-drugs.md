title: "Deep learning, 3-D technology to improve structure modeling, create better drugs"
excerpt: "Now, Purdue University researchers have designed a novel approach to use deep learning to better understand how proteins interact in the bodyâ€”paving the way to producing accurate structure models of protein interactions involved in various diseases and to design better drugs that specifically target protein interactions. The work is released ..."

  - title: "Deep learning, 3D technology to improve structure modeling for protein interactions, create better drugs"
    excerpt: "Kihara and his team developed a system called DOVE, DOcking decoy selection with Voxel-based deep neural nEtwork, which applies deep learning principles to virtual models of protein interactions. DOVE scans the protein-protein interface of a model and then uses deep learning model principles to distinguish and capture structural features of ..."
