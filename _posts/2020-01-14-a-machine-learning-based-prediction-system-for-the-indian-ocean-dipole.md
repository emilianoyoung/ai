title: "A machine learning based prediction system for the Indian Ocean Dipole"
excerpt: "Owing to its large impacts, previous studies have addressed the predictability of the IOD using state of the art coupled climate models. Here, for the first-time, we predict the IOD using machine learning techniques, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs). The IOD forecasts are generated for May to November from February-April conditions."
