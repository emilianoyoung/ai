title: "IBM’s biology-inspired AI generates better hash codes than classical approaches"
excerpt: "To overcome this limitation, researchers at Princeton, the University of San Diego, IBM Research, and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab developed BioHash, which applies “local” and “biologically plausible” synaptic plasticity rules to produce hash codes. They say that it outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing methods ..."
