title: "Maskless, rapid manufacturing of glass microfluidic devices using a picosecond pulsed laser"
excerpt: "The shutter and translation stages were controlled using a G-Code programming language in Ensemble ... Small pieces of the sectioned glass were mounted in epoxy resin (Acri-Kleer, MetPrep, UK), and then mechanically polished using a lapping machine, (LaboPol-5, Struers, Germany) with a 3 micron diamond suspension (MetPrep, UK)."

    excerpt: "Here they bind to complementary mRNA molecules leading to either degradation of the mRNA or inhibition of translation 2. AGO, with the miRNA ... The libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced on a NextSeq500 machine as single-end reads (51 nucleotides) with an average depth of 22 million reads per sample. FASTQ files were generated ..."
