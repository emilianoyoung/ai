  - title: "Imaging technique and machine learning may provide accurate diagnosis of colorectal cancer"
    excerpt: "Using deep learning, a type of machine learning, researchers used the technique on more than 26,000 individual frames of imaging data from colorectal tissue samples to determine the method's accuracy. Compared with pathology reports, they were able to identify tumors with 100% accuracy in this pilot study. This is the first report using this ..."
