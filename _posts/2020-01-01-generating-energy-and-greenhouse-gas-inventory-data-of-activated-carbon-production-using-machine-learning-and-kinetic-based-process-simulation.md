title: "Generating Energy and Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data of Activated Carbon Production Using Machine Learning and Kinetic Based Process Simulation"
excerpt: "This study addresses these knowledge gaps by developing a modeling framework that integrates artificial neural network (ANN), a machine learning approach, and kinetic-based process simulation. The integrated framework is able to generate Life Cycle Inventory data of AC produced from 73 different types of woody biomass with 250 characterization ..."

  - title: "Phase Segmentation in Atom-Probe Tomography Using Deep Learning-Based Edge Detection"
    excerpt: "Alternatively, edge (contour) detection has been significantly improved with deep learning approaches 18. A supervised learning approach is used for edge detection, wherein each pixel is labeled as either edge or nonedge. This approach is slightly different from semantic segmentation in that there are only two classes (edge and noedge ..."

    excerpt: "To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we deployed a deep learning model for retention time prediction applied to small molecule annotation. Results showed that in 70\\(\\%\\) of the cases, the correct molecular identity was ranked among the top 3 candidates based on their predicted retention time. We anticipate that this dataset will enable ..."
