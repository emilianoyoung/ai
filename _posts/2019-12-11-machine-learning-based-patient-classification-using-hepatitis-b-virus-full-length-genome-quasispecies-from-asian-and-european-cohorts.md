title: "Machine-learning based patient classification using Hepatitis B virus full-length genome quasispecies from Asian and European cohorts"
excerpt: "Seroconversion to the HBV e antigen (HBeAg) represents a critical clinical waymark in infected individuals. Using a machine learning approach, a model was developed to determine the viral variants that accurately classify HBeAg status. Serial surveys of patient quasispecies populations and advanced analytics will facilitate clinical decision ..."
