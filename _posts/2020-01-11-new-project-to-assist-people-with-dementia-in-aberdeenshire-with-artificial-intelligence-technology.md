title: "New project to assist people with dementia in Aberdeenshire with artificial intelligence technology"
excerpt: "Aberdeenshire pensioners in the early stages of dementia could soon be assisted by new artificial intelligence technology to stay independent for longer ... or perform other day-to-day activities. The therapy team hopes that introducing them into the homes of those in the initial phases of dementia will help them lead more independent lives."
