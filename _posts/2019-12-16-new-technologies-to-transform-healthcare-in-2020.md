    excerpt: "Researchers at NVIDIA have come up with a clever machine learning technique for taking 2D images and fleshing them out into 3D models. Normally this happens in reverse—these days, it's not all that difficult to take a 3D model and flatten it into a 2D image. But to create a 3D model without feeding a system 3D data is far more challenging."
