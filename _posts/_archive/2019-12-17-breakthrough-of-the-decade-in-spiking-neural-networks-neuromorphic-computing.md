title: "Breakthrough of The Decade in Spiking Neural Networks & Neuromorphic Computing"
excerpt: "According to its developers the machine is capable of performing more that 200 trillion operations per second. Spiking neural networks are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. In a spiking neural ..."
