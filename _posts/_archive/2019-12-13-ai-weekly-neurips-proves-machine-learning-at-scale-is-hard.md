title: "AI Weekly: NeurIPS proves machine learning at scale is hard"
excerpt: "Researchers are presenting more than 1,400 papers at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, ranging from work that organizers believe has had the greatest impact over the past decade to Yoshua Bengio’s continued march toward consciousness for deep learning. But even as the conference showed theoretical research and ..."

  - title: "AI Weekly: Machine learning’s role in climate change"
    excerpt: "It only makes sense that we use the latter to work on the former. That was a significant sub-theme of NeurIPS 2019, highlighted in particular by the Tackling Climate Change workshop, and talk from some prominent leaders in machine learning suggests that the ML field can and should focus on it. There are two thrusts: one is about urging machine ..."
