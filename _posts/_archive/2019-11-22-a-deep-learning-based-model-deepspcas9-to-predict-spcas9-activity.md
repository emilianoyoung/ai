title: "A deep learning-based model DeepSpCas9 to predict SpCas9 activity"
excerpt: "Kim et al. had previously reported on a deep learning-based computational model named DeepCpf1 to predict the activity of a different endonuclease (AsCpf1 from Acidaminococcus species) with high generalization performance. For this, they used lentiviral ..."
