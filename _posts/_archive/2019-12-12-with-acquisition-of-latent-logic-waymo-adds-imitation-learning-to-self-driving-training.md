title: "With Acquisition Of Latent Logic, Waymo Adds Imitation Learning To Self-Driving Training"
excerpt: "Now it will be able to add real-world traffic to its data set. The self-driving taxi company announced the acquisition of Latent Logic, a start-up spun out of Oxford University that developed an “imitation learning” system to train autonomous vehicles. Latent Logic was founded in 2017 in part by Shimon Whiteson, a professor and head of the ..."

    excerpt: "Reinforcement learning agents — or AI that’s progressively spurred toward goals via rewards (or punishments) — form the foundation of self-driving cars, dexterous robots, and drug discovery systems. But because they’re predisposed to explore unfamiliar states, they’re susceptible to what’s called the safe exploration problem ..."
