title: "Integrating Machine Learning with the Multilayer Energy-Based Fragment Method for Excited States of Large Systems"
excerpt: "Find more information on the Altmetric Attention Score and how the score is calculated. In this work we have combined machine learning techniques with our recently developed multilayer energy-based fragment method for studying excited states of large systems. The photochemically active and inert regions are separately treated with the complete ..."
