title: "Fight to finish: AI-on-AI and dev-on-dev speed up model training"
excerpt: "Why would anyone trust artificial intelligence? It’s basically the same reason we trust ourselves ... There is a kind of AI-on-AI approach called Generative Adversarial Networks in which two neural networks constantly work against each other. For example, one side is creating a fake picture while the other tries to guess if it’s fake."
