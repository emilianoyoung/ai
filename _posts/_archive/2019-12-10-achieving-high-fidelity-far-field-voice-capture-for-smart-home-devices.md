title: "Achieving High-Fidelity, Far-Field Voice Capture for Smart Home Devices"
excerpt: "For accurate speech recognition, these systems require speech recordings with low noise and distortion. To achieve low noise and distortion, these systems use multi-channel, high performance signal chains for near- and far-field pick-up of voice commands, along with noise reduction algorithms. Moreover, these systems require good distortion ..."
