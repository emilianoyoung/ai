  - title: "DeepCode AI: Symbolic AI versus Machine Learning"
    excerpt: "In developer communities, this is a double edge sword these days. It feels a bit overhyped (blockchain anyone?). So let me explain what we mean and that it is actually different from pure machine learning here. I guess first we need to agree on what intelligence is. Let us stick to the definition of Intelligence of DeepMind cofounder Shane Legg ..."
