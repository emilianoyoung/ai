title: "Machine learning provides new paradigm in understanding microbial gene regulation"
excerpt: "By applying a machine learning algorithm designed to separate mixed signals into their original sources, researchers were able to split a large high-quality collection of gene expression data into around 100 signals that represent the targeted effects of transcriptional regulators. The work was led by Bernhard Palsson, Galletti Professor of ..."
