title: "Real-time intraoperative diagnosis by deep neural network driven multiphoton virtual histology"
excerpt: "We adopted a physics-based learning strategy to achieve our goal. First, considering the difference in system design and operation between the two datasets, data augmentation with the purpose of artificial degradation was introduced to the original high-quality laboratory-based image data by modelling difference in point spread function (PSF ..."
