    excerpt: "If I ever had to sort that collection by hand, it would probably take me the better part of the next 20 years — but perhaps I could use this AI-powered Lego sorting machine that’s made in large part out of more than 10,000 Lego bricks (via ExtremeTech). Dubbed the “Universal Lego Sorting Machine” by its creator, Daniel West, it’s a ..."

    excerpt: "Others go with the flow, look for the best deals whenever they find some time to shop, not even looking at the brands or what they chose in the past. So why not train a machine learning model to predict the next purchase a given customer will make and estimate when this transaction will take place? There are two approaches to the challenge of ..."
