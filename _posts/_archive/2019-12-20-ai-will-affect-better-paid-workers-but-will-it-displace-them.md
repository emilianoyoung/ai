title: "AI will affect better-paid workers, but will it displace them?"
excerpt: "While it seems likely that automation and robotics will impact, or even displace, jobs on the lower-end of the income and education spectrum, AI may have impacts on better-paid and more educated workers, according to new research from Mark Muro, Robert Maxim, and Jacob Whiton.
