title: "2020 will see AI move from buzzwords to solutions"
excerpt: "As we entrust more parts of our working and personal lives to AI-powered applications, the ethics of AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration. One of the most important ethical questions is about intention — for example, where, when and how AI interacts with the analogue reality that we have all been accustomed to live in."

    excerpt: "Many academics are both surprised and impressed that, although AI ethics has been a topic of study for years, it has become so prominent in discussions about the technology today.
