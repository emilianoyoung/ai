title: "Physics-informed Deep Learning for Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Image Processing"
excerpt: "Thus, this novel, physics-informed deep learning framework represents a superior approach over the traditional material decomposition process, both on objective (i.e. reduced error rate) and subjective (i.e. visual inspection) scales. In addition to their potential for improved image quality, deep learning pipelines allow for accelerated ..."
