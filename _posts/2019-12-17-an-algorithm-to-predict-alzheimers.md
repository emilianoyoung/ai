title: "An algorithm to predict Alzheimer’s"
excerpt: "Their algorithm uses machine learning to first build a list of key clinical terms associated with cognitive symptoms identified by clinical experts, then uses natural language processing (NLP) to comb through EHRs looking for those terms. Finally, the algorithm uses those results to estimate patients’ risk of developing dementia."
