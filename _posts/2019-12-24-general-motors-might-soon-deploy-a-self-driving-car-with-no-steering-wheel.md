  - title: "Stanford Engineers Taught a Self-Driving DeLorean to Drift"
    excerpt: "Since then, mechanical engineer Chris Gerdes and his students developed the self-driving car to drift through a multi-turn, kilometer-long track in just a matter of minutes at a level that’s nearly as good as real professionals. The DeLorean uses GPS coordinates and the algorithms on Jonathan Goh’s laptop to chart its path, meaning those ..."
