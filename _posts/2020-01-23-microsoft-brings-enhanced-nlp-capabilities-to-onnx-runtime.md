    excerpt: "... is the result of a collaboration between Azure AI and Microsoft AI and Research. “Since the BERT model is mainly composed of stacked transformer cells, we optimize each cell by fusing key sub-graphs of multiple elementary operators into single kernels for both CPU and GPU, including Self-Attention, LayerNormalization and Gelu layers."
