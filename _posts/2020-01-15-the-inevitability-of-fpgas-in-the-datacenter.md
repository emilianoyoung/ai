title: "The Inevitability Of FPGAs In The Datacenter"
excerpt: "This, in a nutshell, is what the Vitis machine learning stack, which sits underneath the Caffe and TensorFlow machine learning frameworks and has libraries for running straight AI models or for adding FPGA-boosted AI ... the CUDA parallel computing and offload environment with GPU accelerators a decade ago, and what AMD is doing similarly ..."

    excerpt: "\"For this reason, non-linear methods like MVPA have been at the core of so-called 'Deep Learning' approaches behind technologies, such as the computer vision software required for self-driving cars.\" But MVPA uses brute force machine-learning techniques. The process is opportunistic, sometimes confusing coincidence with correlation. Even ideal ..."
