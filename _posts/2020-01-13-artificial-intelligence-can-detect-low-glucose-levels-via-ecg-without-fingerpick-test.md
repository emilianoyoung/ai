    excerpt: "Researchers from a UK university have devised an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system that can detect low glucose levels ... Based on this information, clinicians can adapt the therapy to each individual. Clearly more clinical research is required to confirm these results in wider populations. This is why we are looking for partners.”"
