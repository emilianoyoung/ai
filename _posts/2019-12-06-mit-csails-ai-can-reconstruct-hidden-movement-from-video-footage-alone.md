title: "MIT CSAIL’s AI can reconstruct hidden movement from video footage alone"
excerpt: "Seeing around corners and through walls is old hat for AI and machine learning algorithms, which are at the heart of systems (some of which use lasers) that produce images outside a sight line. But what about the much more challenging task of reconstructing hidden objects without special equipment? Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and ..."

    excerpt: "AI and machine learning algorithms capable of reading lips from videos aren’t anything out of the ordinary, in truth. Back in 2016, researchers from Google and the University of Oxford detailed a system that could annotate video footage with 46.8% accuracy, outperforming a professional human lip-reader’s 12.4% accuracy. But even state-of ..."

  - title: "Nvidia built an AI that creates 3D models from 2D images"
    excerpt: "What if developing a 3D gaming world were as easy as snapping pics with your phone? Nvidia researchers recently developed an AI system capable of predicting a complete 3D model from any 2D image. Called “DIB-R,” the AI takes a picture of any 2D object – an image of a bird, for example – and predicts what it would look like in three ..."
