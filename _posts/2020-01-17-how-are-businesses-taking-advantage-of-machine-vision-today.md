    excerpt: "The framework takes as input three x-ray images of the bulb and extracts shape, edge, and texture features from each image. These features are then fed into a machine learning regression algorithm in order to predict the 2D projection of the bulb’s growth direction. Using the x-ray system’s geometry, these 2D estimates are then mapped to ..."
