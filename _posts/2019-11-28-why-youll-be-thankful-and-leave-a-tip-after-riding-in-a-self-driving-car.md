title: "Why You’ll Be Thankful And Leave A Tip After Riding In A Self-Driving Car"
excerpt: "Here’s an interesting question to consider: Will we give out tips when ridesharing is being performed by true self-driving cars? Your first thought might be that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to give a tip to a self-driving car. A true self-driving car is being driven by an AI system, and there’s no human driver, so it seems crazy ..."

    excerpt: "A few hundred self-driving cars are undergoing testing on American roads today, using advanced technology to journey down highways, stop at red lights, and avoid pedestrians and cyclists—except when they don’t. More than 60 companies are registered to test in California alone, though just 28 tested on state roads last year. Exactly how many ..."
