title: "Deep Learning Shakes Up Geologists' Tools to Study Seismic Fault Systems"
excerpt: "Identifying these smaller faults is painstaking, requiring weeks to study individual slices from a 3D image. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin are shaking up the process with deep learning models that identify geologic fault systems from 3D seismic images, saving scientists time and resources. The developers used NVIDIA GPUs and ..."
