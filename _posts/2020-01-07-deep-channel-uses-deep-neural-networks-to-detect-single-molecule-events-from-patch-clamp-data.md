title: "Deep-Channel uses deep neural networks to detect single-molecule events from patch-clamp data"
excerpt: "Currently, Deep-Channel can recognise up to five channels opening simultaneously. We have demonstrated here the effectiveness of Deep-Channel, an artificial deep neural network to detect events in single molecule datasets, especially, but not exclusively patch-clamp data, but the potential for deep learning convolution/LSTM networks to tackle ..."
