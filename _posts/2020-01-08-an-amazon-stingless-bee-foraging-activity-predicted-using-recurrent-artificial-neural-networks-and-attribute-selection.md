title: "An Amazon stingless bee foraging activity predicted using recurrent artificial neural networks and attribute selection"
excerpt: "It also may lead to better management and utilization of bees as pollinators. We address an investigation with Recurrent Neural Networks in the task of forecasting beesâ€™ level of activity taking into account previous values of level of activity and environmental data such as temperature, solar irradiance and barometric pressure. We also show ..."
