title: "Using Meta-Learning to Train Agents to Learn Generic Concepts"
excerpt: "Is it possible to recreate this neuroscientific miracle in artificial intelligence(AI) agents? Last year, researchers from OpenAI published a paper proposing a technique for concept learning based on a deep learning method known as energy functions. Energy-Based Models are a class of deep learning algorithms that focus on capturing dependencies ..."

    excerpt: "Now that we’re big into machine learning in the cloud, perhaps we should start thinking about how to do it better ML (machine learning) is handy stuff. Now that public cloud computing has made it cheap, I’m seeing all types of cloud-based applications applying this technology effectively. Basically, there are three types of machine learning."
