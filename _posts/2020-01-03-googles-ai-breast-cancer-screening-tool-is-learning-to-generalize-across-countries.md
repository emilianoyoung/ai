title: "Google’s AI breast cancer screening tool is learning to generalize across countries"
excerpt: "In a preliminary test, a model trained only on data from UK women still performed better than experts on US patients. The news: DeepMind and Google Health have developed a new AI system to help doctors detect breast cancer early. The researchers trained an algorithm on mammogram images from female patients in the US and UK, and it performed ..."
