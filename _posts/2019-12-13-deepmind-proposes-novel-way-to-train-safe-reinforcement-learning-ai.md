title: "DeepMind proposes novel way to train ‘safe’ reinforcement learning AI"
excerpt: "Reinforcement learning agents — or AI that’s progressively spurred toward goals via rewards (or punishments) — form the foundation of self-driving cars, dexterous robots, and drug discovery systems. But because they’re predisposed to explore unfamiliar states, they’re susceptible to what’s called the safe exploration problem ..."

  - title: "AI Weekly: NeurIPS proves machine learning at scale is hard"
    excerpt: "Researchers are presenting more than 1,400 papers at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, ranging from work that organizers believe has had the greatest impact over the past decade to Yoshua Bengio’s continued march toward consciousness for deep learning. But even as the conference showed theoretical research and ..."
