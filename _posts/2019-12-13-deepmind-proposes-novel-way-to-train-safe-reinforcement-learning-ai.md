title: "DeepMind proposes novel way to train ‘safe’ reinforcement learning AI"
excerpt: "Reinforcement learning agents — or AI that’s progressively spurred toward goals via rewards (or punishments) — form the foundation of self-driving cars, dexterous robots, and drug discovery systems. But because they’re predisposed to explore unfamiliar states, they’re susceptible to what’s called the safe exploration problem ..."
