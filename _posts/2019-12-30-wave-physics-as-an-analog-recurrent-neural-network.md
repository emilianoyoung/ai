title: "Wave physics as an analog recurrent neural network"
excerpt: "RNNs are one of the most important machine learning models and have been widely used to perform tasks such as natural language processing (11) and time series prediction (12â€“14). We show that wave-based physical systems can be trained to operate as an RNN and, as a result, can passively process signals and information in their native domain ..."
