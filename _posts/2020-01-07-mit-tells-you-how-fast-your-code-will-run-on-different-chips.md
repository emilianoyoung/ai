title: "MIT tells you how fast your code will run on different chips"
excerpt: "Traditionally, developers used the performance model of compilers through a simulation to run basic blocks of code in order to gauge the performance of a chip. However, these performance models are not often validated through real-life processor performance. WMIT researchers developed an AI model called Ithmel by training it to predict how fast ..."

    excerpt: "However, these performance models are not often validated through real-life processor performance. MIT researchers developed an AI model called Ithmel by training it to predict how fast a chip can run unknown basic blocks. Later, it was supported by a database called BHive with 300,000 basic blocks from specialized fields such as machine ..."
