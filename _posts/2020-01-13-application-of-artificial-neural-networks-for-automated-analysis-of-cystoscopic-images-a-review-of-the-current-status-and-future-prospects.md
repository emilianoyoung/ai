title: "Application of artificial neural networks for automated analysis of cystoscopic images: a review of the current status and future prospects."
excerpt: "AI-assisted cystoscopy may improve image recognition and accelerate data acquisition. To provide a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural network (CNN) applications in cystoscopic image recognition. A detailed search of original articles was performed using the PubMed-MEDLINE database to ..."

  - title: "Deep neural networks for automated detection of marine mammal species"
    excerpt: "We show that deep-learning architectures are capable of producing false-positive rates that are orders of magnitude lower than alternative algorithms while substantially increasing the ability to detect calls. We demonstrate that a deep neural network trained with recordings from a single geographic region recorded over a span of days is ..."
