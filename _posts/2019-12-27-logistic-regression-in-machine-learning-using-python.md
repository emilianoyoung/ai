title: "Logistic Regression in Machine Learning using Python"
excerpt: "Find the sum across all the values in training data. Now that we have the error, we need to update the values of our parameters to minimize this error. This is where the “learning” actually happens, since our model is updating itself based on it’s previous output to obtain a more accurate output in the next step. Hence with each iteration ..."
