title: "Deciphering interaction fingerprints from protein molecular surfaces using geometric deep learning"
excerpt: "Fingerprints may be difficult to grasp by visual analysis but could be learned from large-scale datasets. We present MaSIF (molecular surface interaction fingerprinting), a conceptual framework based on a geometric deep learning method to capture fingerprints that are important for specific biomolecular interactions. We showcase MaSIF with ..."
