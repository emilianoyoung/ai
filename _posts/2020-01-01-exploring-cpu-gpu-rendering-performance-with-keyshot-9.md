title: "Exploring CPU & GPU Rendering Performance With KeyShot 9"
excerpt: "With RTX’s RT cores, ray tracing can be greatly accelerated, while the same kind of boost can be seen to AI denoising thanks to the inclusion of Tensor cores. All around, there’s a lot of GPU love in this release. Bugatti Chiron render in KeyShot 9 (Credit: Nils Piirma) There’s a lot more that’s new to KeyShot 9 than just GPU rendering."

    excerpt: "We remember V-Ray being one of the first places we saw AI denoise hit consumers. On the CPU side, the renderer seems to favor Intel CPUs a bit more than AMD, as we’ve seen in the past – although that’s just from a core count standpoint, not an overall chip value standpoint. For GPU, the scaling seems almost ideal. You get what you pay for ..."
