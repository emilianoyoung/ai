  - title: "Stanford engineers teach self-driving DeLorean to drift"
    excerpt: "The mathematics involved in the code have been made open access and could allow self-driving systems to maneuver a car in emergencies with the skill of a professional drift racer. STANFORD, Calif. — Engineers at Stanford have taught a driverless DeLorean to drift through a racecourse, the university said Friday. The DeLorean, named MARTY ..."

  - title: "Marty, the self-driving DeLorean engineered to dominate test courses"
    excerpt: "Imagine if Marty McFly never actually had to drive the DeLorean in Back to the Future, imagine if the DeLorean just drove itself at 88mph. Standford Unversity engineers perhaps thought of the same thing and decided to make a 1981 DMC DeLorean be independent of its human driver. In the above video released onto the Stanford YouTube Channel ..."

  - title: "Stanford Engineers Taught a Self-Driving DeLorean to Drift"
    excerpt: "Since then, mechanical engineer Chris Gerdes and his students developed the self-driving car to drift through a multi-turn, kilometer-long track in just a matter of minutes at a level that’s nearly as good as real professionals. The DeLorean uses GPS coordinates and the algorithms on Jonathan Goh’s laptop to chart its path, meaning those ..."

    excerpt: "The nearly three-minute-long video shows the all-electric, self-driving 1981 DeLorean DMC-12, named MARTY, performing donuts and figure eights in a smooth and masterful form that’d make you think Block himself, or perhaps a champion Formula D driver, was behind the wheel. But instead, MARTY had Goh and Goel in the passenger and driver seat ..."
