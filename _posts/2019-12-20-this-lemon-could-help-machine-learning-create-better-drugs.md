title: "This 'lemon' could help machine learning create better drugs"
excerpt: "Drug discovery researchers have created a new framework for mining data for training machine learning models. One of the challenges in using machine learning for drug development is to create a process for the computer to extract needed information from a pool of data points. Drug scientists must pull biological data and train the software to ..."
