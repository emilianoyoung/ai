title: "A Deep Learning Framework for Design and Analysis of Surgical Bioprosthetic Heart Valves"
excerpt: "However, such analyses are often computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce the concept of deep learning (DL) based finite element analysis (DLFEA) to learn the deformation biomechanics of bioprosthetic aortic valves directly from simulations. The proposed DL framework can eliminate the time-consuming biomechanics simulations ..."
