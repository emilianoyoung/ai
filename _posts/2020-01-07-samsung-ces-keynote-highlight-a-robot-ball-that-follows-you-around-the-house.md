    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of a lot of Ballie's functionality, though Samsung executives stressed during the keynote that it's on-device AI that Ballie won't share with others. We still have a lot of questions about just what Samsung has planned for Ballie, including what this robot will cost and when it will be available."
