  - title: "Machine learning accurate at colorectal cancer diagnosis, may also predict survival"
    excerpt: "Jan. 2 (UPI) --Can artificial intelligence assist in colon cancer screening? A study published Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine suggests a new machine learning platform can help identify people with colorectal cancers, and perhaps even predict disease severity and chance for survival. According to researchers, the non ..."
