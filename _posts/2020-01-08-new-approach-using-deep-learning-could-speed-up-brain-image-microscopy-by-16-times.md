title: "New approach using deep learning could speed up brain image microscopy by 16 times"
excerpt: "\"If you know the optical properties of your system, then you can deblur your images and get twice the resolution of the original,\" he explained. They believed that deep learning -- a form of machine-learning that uses multiple layers of analysis to progressively extract higher level features from raw input -- could be very useful for increasing ..."

    excerpt: "What is the actual structure of graphene oxide nanoflakes? This question is important for optimizing the properties of the carbon material in real-world applications, and researchers at CSIRO in Australia have now tried to answer it using machine learning. Their approach uses over 20,000 possible structure candidates to find truly ..."

    excerpt: "Turns out, the same goes for machines. The intelligence required for facial recognition demands a very different learning base than the reasoning applied to security tasks such as access control. So, rather than approaching security from the machine-learning standpoint of ingesting masses of data, Amazon Web Services Inc. is training AI in a ..."

    excerpt: "We aimed to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system (CAD) for predicting colorectal polyp histology using deep-learning technology and to validate its performance. Near-focus narrow-band imaging (NBI) pictures of colorectal polyps were retrieved from the database of our institution. Of these, 12480 image patches of 624 polyps were used as a ..."
