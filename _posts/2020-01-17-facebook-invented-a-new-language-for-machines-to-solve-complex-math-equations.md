title: "Facebook Invented a New Language for Machines to Solve Complex Math Equations"
excerpt: "Similar to diagramming a sentence, the program turns equations into a tree that can be read by a computer like any other language. There’s already an extensive amount of research in machine translation, so the Facebook AI team simply used a popular translation model to map problems to solutions. “Our solution was an entirely new approach ..."

Whether it will implement its own technology or use Android’s and iOS’s facilities isn’t yet clear. And whether it will indeed do as it says will be a whole different matter entirely."

    excerpt: "It’s part of the company’s new focus on “embodied AI,” meaning machine learning systems that interact intelligently with their surroundings. That could mean lots of things — responding to a voice command using conversational context, for instance, but also more subtle things like a robot knowing it has entered the wrong room of a house."
