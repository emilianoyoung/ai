title: "Watch this AI goalie psych out its opponent in the most hilarious way"
excerpt: "VANCOUVER, CANADA—No, the red player in the video above isn’t having a seizure. And the blue player isn’t drunk. Instead, you’re watching what happens when one artificial intelligence (AI) gets the better of the other, simply by behaving in an unexpected way. One way to make AI smarter is to have it learn from its environment."
