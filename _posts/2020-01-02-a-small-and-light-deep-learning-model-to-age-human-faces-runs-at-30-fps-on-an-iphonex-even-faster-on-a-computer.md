title: "A small and light deep learning model to age human faces, runs at 30 fps on an iPhoneX, even faster on a computer."
excerpt: "This is a face aging deep learning model. Given an input image and a desired age range, the model ages the face to the desired age group. The age groups are: 10-19 (encoded as the integer 0). 20-29 (encoded as the integer 1). 30-39 (encoded as the integer 2). 40-49 (encoded as the integer 3). 50+ (encoded as the integer 4). It's mostly inspired ..."
