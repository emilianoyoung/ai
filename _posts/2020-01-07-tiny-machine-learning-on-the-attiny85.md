title: "Tiny Machine Learning On The Attiny85"
excerpt: "We tend to think that the lowest point of entry for machine learning (ML) is on a Raspberry Pi, which it definitely is not. [EloquentArduino] has been pushing the limits to the low end of the scale, and managed to get a basic classification model running on the ATtiny85. Using his experience of running ML models on an old Arduino Nano ..."

    excerpt: "Find the sum across all the values in training data. Now that we have the error, we need to update the values of our parameters to minimize this error. This is where the “learning” actually happens, since our model is updating itself based on it’s previous output to obtain a more accurate output in the next step. Hence with each iteration ..."
