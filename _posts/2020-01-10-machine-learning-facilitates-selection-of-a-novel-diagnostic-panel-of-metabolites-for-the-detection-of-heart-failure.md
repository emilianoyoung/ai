title: "Machine-learning facilitates selection of a novel diagnostic panel of metabolites for the detection of heart failure"
excerpt: "The metabolic derangement is common in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The aim of the study was to check feasibility of the combined approach of untargeted metabolomics and machine learning to create a simple and potentially clinically useful diagnostic panel for HFrEF. The study included 67 chronic HFrEF patients (left ..."

    excerpt: "Late last year, I complained to Richard Socher, chief scientist at Salesforce and head of its AI projects, about the term \"artificial intelligence\" and that we should use more accurate terms such as machine learning or smart machine systems, because \"AI\" creates unreasonably high expectations when the vast majority of applications are ..."
