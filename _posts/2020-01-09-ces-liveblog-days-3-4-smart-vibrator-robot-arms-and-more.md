excerpt: "Sensors and cameras (and a little dose of artificial intelligence) tell the arms where things like the salt and pepper are, and I watched as the arms helped a (human) cook make a bowl of tofu salad. Samsung calls it a collaborative robot, so it's not meant to cook from start to finish without any help, but it can take some tasks off your hands ..."
