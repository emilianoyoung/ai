title: "AI chip supports inference in ultra-low-power devices"
excerpt: "“This [memory bandwidth] is now very significant for an MCU-class device,” Croome said. The architecture of GreenWaves’ GAP9 ultra-low power AI chip now uses 10 RISC-V cores (Image: GreenWaves) Changes to the GAP9 architecture also include a much higher top frequency; GAP8 clocked in at 175MHz, GAP9 will run at or close to 400MH"
