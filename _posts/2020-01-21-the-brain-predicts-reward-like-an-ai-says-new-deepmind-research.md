title: "The Brain Predicts Reward Like an AI, Says New DeepMind Research"
excerpt: "The idea of reinforcement learning—or learning based on reward—has been around for so long it’s easy to forget we don’t really know how it works. If DeepMind’s new bombshell paper in Nature is any indication, a common approach in AI, one that’s led to humanity’s defeat in the game of Go against machines, may have the answer."

    excerpt: "Sideways is an alternative to that traditional rule for performing the forward and backward passes. The authors of sideways, Mateusz Malinowski, Grzegorz Świrszcz, João Carreira, and Viorica Pătrăucean, all with the DeepMind unit of Google, noticed that a deep learning neural net is doing less than it could be doing at every moment in ..."
