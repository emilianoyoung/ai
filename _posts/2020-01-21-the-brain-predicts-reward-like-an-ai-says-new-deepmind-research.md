title: "The Brain Predicts Reward Like an AI, Says New DeepMind Research"
excerpt: "The idea of reinforcement learning—or learning based on reward—has been around for so long it’s easy to forget we don’t really know how it works. If DeepMind’s new bombshell paper in Nature is any indication, a common approach in AI, one that’s led to humanity’s defeat in the game of Go against machines, may have the answer."

    excerpt: "Developments in artificial intelligence often draw inspiration from how humans think, but now AI has turned the tables to teach us about how brains learn. Will Dabney at tech firm DeepMind in London and his colleagues have found that a recent development in machine learning called distributional reinforcement learning also provides a new ..."
