title: "Robots could harness AI to master sandwich making"
excerpt: "Dr Baihua Li and her researchers are developing machine vision and embedded AI technology for the company’s 'Delta' robots ... such as items being misplaced or missing. Eventually, the robots could make and package sandwiches from start to finish without human intervention, allowing human workers to focus on “higher-value” activities."
