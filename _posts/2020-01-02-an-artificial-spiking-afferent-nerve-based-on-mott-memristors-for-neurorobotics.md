title: "An artificial spiking afferent nerve based on Mott memristors for neurorobotics"
excerpt: "However, an interface (called an afferent nerve in biology) with the environment, which converts the analog signal from sensors into spikes in spiking neural networks, is yet to be demonstrated. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate an artificial spiking afferent nerve based on highly reliable NbO x Mott memristors for the first time."
