    excerpt: "Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of a lot of Ballie's functionality, though Samsung executives stressed during the keynote that it's on-device AI that Ballie won't share with others. We still have a lot of questions about just what Samsung has planned for Ballie, including what this robot will cost and when it will be available."

    excerpt: "Samsung's CES 2020 keynote was odd - it wasn't about product at all. The future of the smart home, the smart city, the smart car... that was all covered, but nothing about TVs, phones or things we're used to seeing."
