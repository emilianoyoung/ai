title: "Mock Skyscrapers, Simulated Rain At Singapore Self-driving Test Centre"
excerpt: "Shipping containers are also stacked up to emulate how high rises could potentially block satellite signals to self-driving machines. The CETRAN centre, run by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), even has a rain-making machine that can simulate the frequent tropical downpours in the Southeast Asian city-state of 5.7 million people."

    excerpt: "According to our partners at TribLive.com, the rideshare company is buying about 600 acres of land. This comes nearly a year after Uber resumed testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. The company had shut down the program for most of 2018 after a deadly crash in Arizona. Uber is also testing self-driving semitrucks at a site in Hazelwood."
