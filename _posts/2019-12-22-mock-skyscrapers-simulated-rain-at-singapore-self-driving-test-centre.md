title: "Mock Skyscrapers, Simulated Rain At Singapore Self-driving Test Centre"
excerpt: "Shipping containers are also stacked up to emulate how high rises could potentially block satellite signals to self-driving machines. The CETRAN centre, run by Nanyang Technological University (NTU), even has a rain-making machine that can simulate the frequent tropical downpours in the Southeast Asian city-state of 5.7 million people."
