title: "Artificial Neural Networks For Blockchain: A Primer"
excerpt: "Artificial intelligence -- and especially neural networks -- poses a solution to these problems by using them in a new, energy-saving protocol called proof of artificial intelligence (PoAI). Proposed by J. Chen et al. (2018), the proof of artificial intelligence protocol uses a pretrained CNN to determine the average transaction number (AVN ..."
