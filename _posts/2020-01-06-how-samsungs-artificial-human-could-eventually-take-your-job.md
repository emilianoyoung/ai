title: "How Samsung's 'Artificial Human' Could Eventually Take Your Job"
excerpt: "And as great as artificial intelligence might be, there's no guarantee that it'll work as well as a human being. But alas, Samsung is moving towards the concept. And soon enough, we might be seeing \"artificial humans\" transform the office. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com."

    excerpt: "But don't expect them to show up as physical robots, he said. That's not the plan for Neon ... Mistry envision Neons to be sort of a digital version of a \"dear diary\" or a close confidant. They're run by advanced artificial intelligence, and they're constantly learning and building memories from their interactions with you."
