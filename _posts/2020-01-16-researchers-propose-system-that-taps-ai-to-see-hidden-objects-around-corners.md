title: "Researchers propose system that taps AI to see hidden objects around corners"
excerpt: "To reconstruct the object from the speckle pattern, the researchers tapped an AI algorithm trained on synthesized data of characterized noise, which eliminated the need to capture experimental training samples. Crucially, it’s able to operate with the shorter exposure times necessary for real-time imaging, exaplined coauthor Prasanna ..."

  - title: "Artificial Intelligence Can See Around Corners in Real Time"
    excerpt: "Detailed, fast imaging of hidden objects could help self-driving cars detect hazards. Researchers have harnessed the power of a type of artificial intelligence known as deep learning to create a new laser-based system that can image around corners in real time. With further development, the system might let self-driving cars “look” around ..."
