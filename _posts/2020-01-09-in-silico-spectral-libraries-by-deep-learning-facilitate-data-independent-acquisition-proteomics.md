title: "In silico spectral libraries by deep learning facilitate data-independent acquisition proteomics"
excerpt: "Herein, we propose DeepDIA, a deep learning-based approach to generate in silico spectral libraries for DIA analysis. We demonstrate that the quality of in silico libraries predicted by instrument-specific models using DeepDIA is comparable to that of experimental libraries, and outperforms libraries generated by global models. With peptide ..."
