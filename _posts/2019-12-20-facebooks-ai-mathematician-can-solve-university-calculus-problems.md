title: "Facebook's AI mathematician can solve university calculus problems"
excerpt: "François Charton and Guillaume Lample at Facebook AI Research trained an AI on tens of millions of calculus problems randomly generated by a computer. The problems were mathematical expressions that involved integration, a common technique in calculus for finding the area under a curve. To find solutions, the AI used natural language ..."

  - title: "Facebook has a neural network that can do advanced math"
    excerpt: "And yet today, Guillaume Lample and François Charton, at Facebook AI Research in Paris, say they have developed an algorithm that does the job with just a moment’s thought. These guys have trained a neural network to perform the necessary symbolic reasoning to differentiate and integrate mathematical expressions for the first time."

  - title: "Facebook's Neural Net Can Solve This Differential Equation in One Second"
    excerpt: "This is how we learn to recognize patterns. Similarly, neural networks rely on layers and layers of artificial \"neurons\" that mirror the ones in our own brain—only these so-called neurons perform basic calculations. With enough of these working together, the entire network has the power to solve more complex problems, even though individual ..."
