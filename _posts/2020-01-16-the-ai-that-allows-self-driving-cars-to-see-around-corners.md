title: "The AI that allows self-driving cars to ‘see’ around corners"
excerpt: "Researchers at US universities have created an imaging system powered by artificial intelligence that could help self-driving cars \"see\" around corners in minute detail to identify hazards. The imaging system uses a conventional camera sensor and a laser beam that can be \"bounced\" off walls and onto objects to create a pattern – visually ..."

    excerpt: "To reconstruct the object from the speckle pattern, the researchers tapped an AI algorithm trained on synthesized data of characterized noise, which eliminated the need to capture experimental training samples. Crucially, it’s able to operate with the shorter exposure times necessary for real-time imaging, exaplined coauthor Prasanna ..."
