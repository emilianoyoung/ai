title: "Uber Creates Generative Teaching Networks to Better Train Deep Neural Networks"
excerpt: "The generator and the learner networks are trained with meta-learning via nested optimization that consists of inner and outer training loops. In the GTN model, the generator produces completely new artificial data that a never-seen-before learner neural network (with a randomly sampled architecture and weight initialization) trains on for a ..."

  - title: "Viewpoint: Physics Insights from Neural Networks"
    excerpt: "A neural network is a computational tool whose operation is loosely modeled on that of the human brain. The network typically consists of multiple layers of connected artificial neurons, which carry out calculations. The connections between neurons are weighted and those weights—which can number in the millions to billions—form the tunable ..."

    excerpt: "The neural network helps us control the position of the crystal ... Other optimization technologies need large datasets. Thus, we choose the Artificial neuron network (ANN) as our optimization tool. Our ANN can perform real-time operations to give the optimal parameter solution in the current environment. We train the ANN each time because ..."
