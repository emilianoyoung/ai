title: "Predicting Effective Diffusivity of Porous Media from Images by Deep Learning"
excerpt: "Machine learning can potentially be an effective approach for tackling the above challenge. Deep neural networks have demonstrated good predictive power when their input and output have important correlation with each other. Furthermore, image-based learning has been shown to be able to extract important physical features from images 8,9."
