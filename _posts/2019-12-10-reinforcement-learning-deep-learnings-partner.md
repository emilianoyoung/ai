title: "Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning’s Partner"
excerpt: "This year, we have seen all the hype around AI Deep Learning. With recent innovations, deep learning demonstrated its usefulness in performing tasks such as image recognition, voice recognition, price forecasting, across many industries. It’s easy to overestimate deep learning’s capabilities and pretend it’s the magic bullet that will ..."

  - title: "DeepMind proposes novel way to train ‘safe’ reinforcement learning AI"
    excerpt: "Reinforcement learning agents — or AI that’s progressively spurred toward goals via rewards (or punishments) — form the foundation of self-driving cars, dexterous robots, and drug discovery systems. But because they’re predisposed to explore unfamiliar states, they’re susceptible to what’s called the safe exploration problem ..."

  - title: "Data-driven deep reinforcement learning"
    excerpt: "One of the primary factors behind the success of machine learning approaches in open world settings, such as image recognition and natural language processing, has been the ability of high-capacity deep neural network function approximators to learn generalizable models from large amounts of data. Deep reinforcement learning methods ..."
