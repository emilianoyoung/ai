title: "AMD’s third shoe finally drops at CES 2020—7nm Zen 2 mobile CPUs"
excerpt: "It's still very early days to estimate just how powerful Intel's new line of GPUs will be—for either traditional GPU work like gaming and content creation, or for AI acceleration—but we saw a laptop with Intel's DG1 discrete graphics doing a good job playing Destiny 2, so it's equally early to rule Intel out of the high-performance GPU game."
