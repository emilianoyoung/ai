title: "Fingerprint Recognition for the Car: Use Cases and Design Considerations"
excerpt: "It handles models like WaveRNN and Tacotron 2. RNNs are also used for speech recognition and language translation. In addition, the new compiler is optimized to handle transformer-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is used for natural language processing tasks. On top of that, Nvidia is ..."

    excerpt: "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a Natural Language Processing model that Google introduced in 2018 and began rolling out in October 2019. BERT has the ability to consider the full context of a word based on the words that come before or after named entities. We won’t dive deep, but we’ll look at an example ..."
