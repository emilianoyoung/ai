    excerpt: "According to our partners at TribLive.com, the rideshare company is buying about 600 acres of land. This comes nearly a year after Uber resumed testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. The company had shut down the program for most of 2018 after a deadly crash in Arizona. Uber is also testing self-driving semitrucks at a site in Hazelwood."
