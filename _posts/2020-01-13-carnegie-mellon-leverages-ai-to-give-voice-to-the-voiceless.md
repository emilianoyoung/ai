  - title: "Carnegie Mellon researchers propose AI that surfaces positive online comments"
    excerpt: "As the researchers explain, improvements in AI language models — which learn from many examples to predict what words are likely to occur in a given sentence — made it possible to analyze such large quantities of text. The study’s contribution was a technique enabling those models to digest short texts originating from South Asia ..."

  - title: "Amazon researchers trained an AI model in multiple languages to improve product searches"
    excerpt: "They say that their AI, which was trained on data from several different languages at once, delivered better results using any of those languages. As Amazon applied scientist Nikhil Rao explained in a blog post, the reason for the improvement is that a corpus in one language is able to fill gaps in that of another language. For instance ..."
