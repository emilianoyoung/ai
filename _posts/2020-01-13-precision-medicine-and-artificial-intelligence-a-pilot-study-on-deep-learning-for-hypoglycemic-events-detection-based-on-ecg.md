title: "Precision Medicine and Artificial Intelligence: A Pilot Study on Deep Learning for Hypoglycemic Events Detection based on ECG"
excerpt: "Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave, ST-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive ..."

    excerpt: "Owing to its large impacts, previous studies have addressed the predictability of the IOD using state of the art coupled climate models. Here, for the first-time, we predict the IOD using machine learning techniques, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs). The IOD forecasts are generated for May to November from February-April conditions."

    excerpt: "Tuberculosis (TB) is the world’s leading infectious disease killer. Early and accurate detection of TB is essential to achieve global control of the disease. However, many high-burden countries continue to have large gaps in TB diagnosis. India has the world’s largest TB burden and accounts for over one quarter of the 3.8 million ‘missing ..."
