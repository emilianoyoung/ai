title: "Democratizing the optimization of AI’s arcane neural networks"
excerpt: "We’re only a few weeks into the new year, but already we’re seeing signs that automated machine learning modeling, sometimes known as autoML, is rising to a new plateau of sophistication. Specifically, it appears that a promising autoML approach known as “neural architecture search” will soon become part of data scientists’ core toolkits."
