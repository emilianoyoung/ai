title: "Watch This Self-Driving Electric DeLorean Drift Flawlessly Around an Entire Racecourse"
excerpt: "Forget going back to the future; we are well and truly in it. A group of brainiac engineers at Stanford University just built an all-electric, self-driving drifting machine and sent it power sliding like a pro around an entire racecourse. And it wasn’t just any old car, but the undisputed star of the Back to the Future series: the iconic ..."
