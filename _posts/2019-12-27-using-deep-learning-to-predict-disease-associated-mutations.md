title: "Using deep learning to predict disease-associated mutations"
excerpt: "This is the first deep learning approach for the prediction of disease-associated metal-relevant site mutations in metalloproteins, providing a new platform to tackle human diseases. The research findings were recently published in a top scientific journal Nature Machine Intelligence. Metal ions play pivotal roles either structurally or ..."
