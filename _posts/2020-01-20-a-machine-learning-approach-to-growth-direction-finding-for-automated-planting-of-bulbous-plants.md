title: "A Machine Learning Approach to Growth Direction Finding for Automated Planting of Bulbous Plants"
excerpt: "The framework takes as input three x-ray images of the bulb and extracts shape, edge, and texture features from each image. These features are then fed into a machine learning regression algorithm in order to predict the 2D projection of the bulb’s growth direction. Using the x-ray system’s geometry, these 2D estimates are then mapped to ..."

  - title: "Using machine learning to fine-tune views of the ancient past"
    excerpt: "A team of researchers affiliated with several institutions in China and two in the U.S. has developed a way to use machine learning to get a better look at the past. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes how they used machine learning to analyze records of the past. Scientists use fossils to date rocks because ..."
