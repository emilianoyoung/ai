title: "MIT creates an AI that understands the laws of physics intuitively"
excerpt: "But it turns out that the technology could also help give us a better understanding of ourselves. At least that's what a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) think they'll be able to do with their new AI model. Dubbed ADEPT, the system is able to, like a human being, understand some laws of physics intuitively."
