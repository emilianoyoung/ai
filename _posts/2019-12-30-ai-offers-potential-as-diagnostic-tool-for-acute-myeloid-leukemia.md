title: "AI offers potential as diagnostic tool for acute myeloid leukemia"
excerpt: "We therefore wanted to find out what an analysis of the transcriptome can achieve using artificial intelligence—that is to say trainable algorithms ... Possibly, the diagnosis would then happen earlier than it does now, and therapy could start earlier.” Although researchers have not yet developed such a test, they believe they have ..."
