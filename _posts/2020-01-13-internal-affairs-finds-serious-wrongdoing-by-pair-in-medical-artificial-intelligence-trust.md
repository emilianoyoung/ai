title: "Internal Affairs finds 'serious wrongdoing' by pair in medical artificial intelligence trust"
excerpt: "Read David Farrier's original investigation into Terrible, Zach and the Whales here, and the followup feature here.

Despite being valued by its keepers at nearly $500 million, Zach was, it seemed to me, less of an AI and more a person banging away at a keyboard."
