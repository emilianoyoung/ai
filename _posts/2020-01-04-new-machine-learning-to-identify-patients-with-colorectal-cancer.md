title: "New Machine Learning to Identify Patients with Colorectal Cancer"
excerpt: "platform can identify patients with colorectal cancer and helps predict their disease severity and survival, finds a new study. The non-invasive method adds to recent advances in technologies that analyse circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and could help spot colorectal cancers in at-risk patients at earlier stages."

  - title: "Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment planning for colorectal polyps using a deep-learning model"
    excerpt: "We aimed to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system (CAD) for predicting colorectal polyp histology using deep-learning technology and to validate its performance. Near-focus narrow-band imaging (NBI) pictures of colorectal polyps were retrieved from the database of our institution. Of these, 12480 image patches of 624 polyps were used as a ..."
