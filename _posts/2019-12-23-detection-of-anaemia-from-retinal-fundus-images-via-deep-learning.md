title: "Detection of anaemia from retinal fundus images via deep learning"
excerpt: "Owing to the invasiveness of diagnostic tests for anaemia and the costs associated with screening for it, the condition is often undetected. Here, we show that anaemia can be detected via machine-learning algorithms trained using retinal fundus images, study participant metadata (including race or ethnicity, age, sex and blood pressure ..."

    excerpt: "The identified urinary biomarkers could be used to develop a point of care test for UTI but require further validation. This is one of the first studies to use machine learning methods to select clinical features and urinary immunological markers to predict culture results for uncomplicated UTI in primary care. We found that cloudiness of urine ..."
