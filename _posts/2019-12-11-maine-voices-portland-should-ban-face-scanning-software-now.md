title: "Maine Voices: Portland should ban face-scanning software – now"
excerpt: "At their Nov. 18 meeting, the Portland City Council delayed voting on a proposal to ban the use of facial recognition software by city employees. The reason? To give councilors more time to study the issue. I was at the meeting to provide public comment as an academic expert on surveillance. The issue is clear. No further study is needed."
