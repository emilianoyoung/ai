title: "Breakthrough of The Decade in Spiking Neural Networks & Neuromorphic Computing"
excerpt: "According to its developers the machine is capable of performing more that 200 trillion operations per second. Spiking neural networks are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. In a spiking neural ..."

    excerpt: "This is how we learn to recognize patterns. Similarly, neural networks rely on layers and layers of artificial \"neurons\" that mirror the ones in our own brainâ€”only these so-called neurons perform basic calculations. With enough of these working together, the entire network has the power to solve more complex problems, even though individual ..."
