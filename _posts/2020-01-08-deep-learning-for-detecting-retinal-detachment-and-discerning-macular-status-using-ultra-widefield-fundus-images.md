title: "Deep learning for detecting retinal detachment and discerning macular status using ultra-widefield fundus images"
excerpt: "Manual retinal detachment screening is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is difficult for large-scale clinical applications. In this study, we developed a cascaded deep learning system based on the ultra-widefield fundus images for automated retinal detachment detection and macula-on/off retinal detachment discerning. The performance ..."
