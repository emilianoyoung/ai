title: "Google Heath’s AI outperforms radiologists at breast cancer screening"
excerpt: "The research conducted by experts from Google Health, Alphabet’s DeepMind unit, and UK and US universities and published in the scientific journal Nature, shows that the AI reduced both false positives, as well as false negatives. Around one in five breast cancers are not detected by conventional mammogram screening, and the chance of a false ..."
