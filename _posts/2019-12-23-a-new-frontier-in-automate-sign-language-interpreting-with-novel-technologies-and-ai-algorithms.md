title: "A new frontier in automate sign language interpreting with novel technologies and AI algorithms."
excerpt: "the AI will be trained with the generated database and will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning algorithms, so that the spoken language is recognized, converted into gestures and expressions of sign language which the Realatar can execute. Finally, thanks to HbbTV technologies, the Realatar is made accessible to people ..."

  - title: "How Emerging Technologies Will Radically Change the Luxury Car"
    excerpt: "“The artificial intelligence stack has to be taught anew in each city,” Roy says ... “When you think 30 years down the track, and the Waymo [autonomous] driver being an enabler, it becomes a blank sheet.” And creativity need not stop at the vehicle manufacturing. The interior and exterior could be painstakingly hand-finished using ..."

  - title: "Improving Algorithms With High-Level Synthesis"
    excerpt: "Sometimes the results of HLS are seen feeding back into the algorithm. Klein said he recently worked on a voice recognition system in which the original TensorFlow algorithm, as defined by the data scientists, called for a feature map of spectral data in a 99 x 40 array of floating-point numbers. “That worked great when the algorithm was ..."
