title: "The Machines Are Learning, and So Are the Students"
excerpt: "For years, people have tried to re-engineer learning with artificial intelligence, but it was not until the machine-learning revolution of the past seven years that real progress has been made. Slowly, algorithms are making their way into classrooms, taking over repetitive tasks like grading, optimizing coursework to fit individual student ..."

  - title: "Machine learning helps tame a sea of plankton species data"
    excerpt: "So many fossils, so little time — to train people to identify them. As scientists grapple with a vast backlog of marine fossils waiting for identification, an international group led by Yale has begun using machine-learning techniques to tackle the mammoth task facing researchers who study the oceans’ most prolific forms of life."
