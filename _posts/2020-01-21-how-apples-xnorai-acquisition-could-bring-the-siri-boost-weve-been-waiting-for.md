title: "How Apple’s Xnor.ai acquisition could bring the Siri boost we’ve been waiting for"
excerpt: "the A13 Bionic chip already has a powerful Neural Engine, but Edge Ai could bring it to the next level. But Xnor.ai’s Edge AI engine could be the thing that brings everything together. It’s unlikely that we’ll see any fruits from Apple’s purchase in the iPhone 12 or even the iPhone 13, but Apple’s incredible silicon advancements ..."

    excerpt: "It’s part of the company’s new focus on “embodied AI,” meaning machine learning systems that interact intelligently with their surroundings. That could mean lots of things — responding to a voice command using conversational context, for instance, but also more subtle things like a robot knowing it has entered the wrong room of a house."
