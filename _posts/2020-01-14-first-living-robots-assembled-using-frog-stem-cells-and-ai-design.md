  - title: "World's First 'Living Machine' Created Using Frog Cells and Artificial Intelligence"
    excerpt: "Scientists used computer algorithms to \"evolve\" an organism that's made of 100% frog DNA — but it isn't a frog. What happens when you take cells from frog embryos and grow them into new organisms that were \"evolved\" by algorithms? You get something that researchers are calling the world's first \"living machine.\" Though the original stem cells ..."

    excerpt: "However, their lifespan can increase to several weeks in nutrient-rich environments. And although the supercomputer -- a powerful piece of artificial intelligence -- plays a big role in building these robots, it's \"unlikely\" that the AI could have evil intentions. \"At the moment though it is difficult to see how an AI could create harmful ..."
