title: "What is Machine Learning? Why its Matters and how does it works?"
excerpt: "The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. Machine learning algorithms find natural patterns in data that generate insight and help you make better decisions and predictions. They are used every ..."

  - title: "An algorithm that learns through rewards may show how our brain does too"
    excerpt: "In a paper published in Nature today, DeepMind, Alphabetâ€™s AI subsidiary, has once again used lessons from reinforcement learning to propose a new theory about the reward mechanisms within our brains. The hypothesis, supported by initial experimental findings, could not only improve our understanding of mental health and motivation."
