title: "What is Machine Learning? Why its Matters and how does it works?"
excerpt: "Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with ..."

    excerpt: "In a paper published in Nature today, DeepMind, Alphabetâ€™s AI subsidiary, has once again used lessons from reinforcement learning to propose a new theory about the reward mechanisms within our brains. The hypothesis, supported by initial experimental findings, could not only improve our understanding of mental health and motivation."
