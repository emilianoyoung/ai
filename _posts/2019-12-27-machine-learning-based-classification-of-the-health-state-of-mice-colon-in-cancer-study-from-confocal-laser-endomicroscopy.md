title: "Machine Learning-Based Classification of the Health State of Mice Colon in Cancer Study from Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy"
excerpt: "In this article, we address the problem of the classification of the health state of the colonâ€™s wall of mice, possibly injured by cancer with machine learning approaches. This problem is essential for translational research on cancer and is a priori challenging since the amount of data is usually limited in all preclinical studies for ..."
