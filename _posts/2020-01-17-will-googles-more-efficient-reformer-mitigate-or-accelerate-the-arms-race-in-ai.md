title: "Will Google’s more-efficient ‘Reformer’ mitigate or accelerate the arms race in AI?"
excerpt: "Also: AI is changing the entire nature of compute \"The reversible Transformer does not need to store activations in each layer and so gets rid of the nl term,\" write Kitaev and colleagues, referring to the N layers of a network. With these efficiencies, they are able to cram a twenty-layer Transformer into a single GPU, they write."
