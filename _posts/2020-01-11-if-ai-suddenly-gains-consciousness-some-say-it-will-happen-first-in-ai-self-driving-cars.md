title: "If AI Suddenly Gains Consciousness, Some Say It Will Happen First In AI Self-Driving Cars"
excerpt: "There has been a lot of speculation that one of these days there will be an AI system that suddenly and unexpectedly gives rise to consciousness. Often referred to as the singularity, there is much hand-wringing that we are perhaps dooming ourselves to either utter death and destruction or to becoming slaves of AI once the singularity occurs."
