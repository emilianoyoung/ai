title: "Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks in TensorFlow"
excerpt: "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are ideal for considering sequences of data. You'll explore how word embeddings are used for sentiment analysis using neural networks. You'll be able to understand and implement word embedding algorithms to generate numeric representations of text, and build a basic classification model. Start learning!"
