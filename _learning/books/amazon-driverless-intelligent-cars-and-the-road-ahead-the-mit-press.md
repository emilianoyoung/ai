title: "Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead (The MIT Press)"
excerpt: "In the coming decade, intelligent cars and trucks will hit the streets, rearranging established industries, enabling new business models, saving lives, easing air pollution, and reshaping cities. Long-suffering commuters will finally be able to live wherever they wish, and read (or nap) on their drive to work. The bad news is that hundreds of thousands of driving-related jobs are at risk, our legal system will need to be re-drawn, and passenger privacy could become a luxury of the past."
