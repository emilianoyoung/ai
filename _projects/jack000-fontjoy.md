[How it works](https://fontjoy.com/pairing/)

Font pairing is a classic problem in the design world. Different fonts can be used to draw attention, lead the eye, or even form the foundations of a brand identity.

What exactly is a good font pairing? This is a difficult question to answer, but we can start with an easier question - what are bad font pairings?

Pairing fonts that are very similar, but just slightly different creates visual conflict. This is actually a core tenet of design - contrast is important not only in font selection but color and position as well.

Fonts that share no relationship at all are not great either. Intent is another foundational aspect of design - things that look random and haphazard tend to evoke a feeling of discord (unless that's the effect you're going for)
