**News: Our crowdfunding campaign is live on www.igg.me/at/nybble !**

This is the repository for OpenCat project. 

The goal is to collaborate talents for this cute quadruped robot. It's still a complex system only for skilled makers, yet we want to share it with the public by mass production and bringing down the cost. 

In the **Wiki** tab, there's a slow documenting process going on. 

We just acquired our official domain: www.petoi.com. You can subscribe for our official newsletters.

Random updates will be posted on Twitter [@PetoiCamp](https://twitter.com/petoicamp), Instagram [@Petoi_Camp](https://www.instagram.com/petoi_camp/), and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/rongzhongli)
