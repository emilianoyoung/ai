## What happens when artificial intelligence tries to draw your photo?

Cartoonify turns your photo into a cartoon drawing, powered by [Draw This](https://github.com/danmacnish/cartoonify) by [Dan Macnish](http://danmacnish.com/2018/07/01/draw-this/) and the Google [QuickDraw dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).

## About this project

Cartoonify uses a neural network to turn your uploaded photo into a unique cartoon. This project was based off of Dan Macnish's Draw This project, which was a camera that turned the images it took into cartoons.
Instead of requiring a Raspberry Pi based camera, this site allows anyone to try cartooning any image.

For best results, try using images with clear objects on a solid background.
